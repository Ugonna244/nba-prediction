Applying machine learning to predict the nba winner for 2022


Veegil Media Data Scientist Assessment: NBA predictions

1. Using the information and data provided below, develop a model that would predict the teams that would qualify for the 2021-2022 NBA PLAYOFFS from both East and west conference and the eventual winners of each conference and the NBA finals.

2. Create a fictional team of 15 players chosen randomly from the available players and predict the outcome of your fictional team for the 2021-2022 NBA season.

3. Explain your choice of model and assumptions and make adequate use of comments to explain variables, functions, and overall algorithms and work.

Stand out (Extra points):

1. Prepare a data pipeline for this work assuming the model was to be deployed to run in parallel on a cluster of machines using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark.

2. Deploy model to the web using a web service (e.g. Heroku, AWS, GCP, or any other cloud service provider) and create a simple User Interface to utilize it.

NOTE:

1. The winners from each conference play against each other in the NBA finals which is a best-of-7-games series like other playoff series.

2. The NBA teams https://www.nba.com/teams are organized in conferences as such: Atlantic, Central, and South East teams are in the Eastern conference while Northwest, Pacific, and Southwest teams are in the Western Conference.
